Hackers-On-the-Go
=================

As a side project of sorts, I’ve been putting together an Android application that provides access to all major functions of our corporate intranet system from a mobile device. Attendance logging, messaging, and project workflows will all be accessible from anywhere, which will be a huge help for a company with a workforce distributed across multiple time zones (and continents).

Because I’m a part of the research team and not in the IT department, I don’t have access to any sort of API or actual function calls. As a result, I’ve devised a solution that uses the open-source WebDriver / HTMLUnit framework to simulate browser clicks on the backend. Not an ideal solution, clearly, but it should demonstrate my capacity to “think outside the box.”

About 50 percent of the functionality has been implemented thus far...
